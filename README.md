--set up accounts (Devise gem used)

--users get welcome emails when they set up accounts

--post "tweets" (dynamic AJAX functionality used)

--users get email notification if they are mentioned in another's tweet

--view their profile page and pages of other users

--click on a "follow" link to follow other users (and view who they are following on their own profile page)
