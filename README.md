Rails app (including some AJAX functionality): reproduces basic functionality of Twitter. Users can:

--set up accounts (Devise gem used)
--post "tweets" (dynamic AJAX functionality used)
--view their profile page and pages of other users
--click on a "follow" link to follow other users (and view who they are following on their own profile page)
