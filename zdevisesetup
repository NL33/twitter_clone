gem 'devise'
$ rails g devise:install
***
Devise instructions:
 1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root to: "home#index"

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:  [see application file here]

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

  4. If you are deploying on Heroku with Rails 3.2 only, you may want to set:

       config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

     On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
     or load models when precompiling your assets.

  5. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

       $ rails g devise:views
 ***

 $ rails g devise:views creates the following:
       invoke  Devise::Generators::SharedViewsGenerator
      create    app/views/devise/shared
      create    app/views/devise/shared/_links.html.erb
      invoke  form_for
      create    app/views/devise/confirmations
      create    app/views/devise/confirmations/new.html.erb
      create    app/views/devise/passwords
      create    app/views/devise/passwords/edit.html.erb
      create    app/views/devise/passwords/new.html.erb
      create    app/views/devise/registrations
      create    app/views/devise/registrations/edit.html.erb

      create    app/views/devise/sessions
      create    app/views/devise/sessions/new.html.erb
      create    app/views/devise/unlocks
      create    app/views/devise/unlocks/new.html.erb
      invoke  erb
      create    app/views/devise/mailer
      create    app/views/devise/mailer/confirmation_instructions.html.erb
      create    app/views/devise/mailer/reset_password_instructions.html.erb
